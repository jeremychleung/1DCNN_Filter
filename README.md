This repository contains sample codes of constructing a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) temporal filter. We intended to create this code (and 1D-CNN filter) for analyzing data of meteorology, climate, atmospheric and oceanic sciences, etc., but the filter could be applied to other kinds of data theoretically.

**About the 1D-CNN temporal filter**
-----
- Traditional, widely used temporal filters, such as FFT ans Lanczos filter, relies on a certain number of neighboring data points to calculate the output value of each point. Thus, there will be loss of data at the very beginning and the end of the filtered output, depending on the length of window applied. Due to the same reason, the filter may be unable to work properly if missing values exist in the input time series, and will result in no valid output values near missing values (see https://www.ncl.ucar.edu/Applications/filter.shtml).
- Incomplete (or discontinuous) time series is a common and unavoidable issue in meteorological data, especially for in-situ observations.
- The 1D-CNN temperoal filter, which is designed to consists of a combination of convolutional and subtraction layers, may address the above issue(s).
- The convolutional layer serves as lowpass filters of different cut-off frequencies or periods. The subtraction layer is used to remove any unwanted signals.
- The combination of subtractive and convolutional layers acts as a high-pass filter by removing the low-pass filtered signal generated by the convolutional layer.
- One could build a highpass, bandpass, or lowpass filter by employing different combinations of convolutional and subtraction layers.

A Tensorflow version was also provided by [Stan and Mantripragada (2023)]([https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/aies/2/4/AIES-D-22-0079.1.xml](https://github.com/cristianastan2/AIES-Deep-Learning-Filter)).

  - Description: These four folders are output data generated based on the provided sample code and data. Among them, the output_data folder includes the time series after lanczos filtering and 1D-CNN filtering in 2022. The 2009-2021data folder includes the original time series from 2009-2021 and the time series after lanczos filtering.The image_mean_temp folder includes MSE loss and correlation coefficient charts for the daily average temperature at the HKO site during the training and validation processes after being processed by 1D-CNN and Lanczos filters, as well as a comparative time series graph of the daily average temperature at the HKO site before and after being filtered by Lanczos and 1D-CNN filters in 2022.The model weight folder contains the weights of the 1D-CNN model.
